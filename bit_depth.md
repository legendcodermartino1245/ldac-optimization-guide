## Inner workings of LDAC

LDAC supports sample rates ranging from **44.1 kHz to 96 kHz**, quality modes of **330**, **660**, **990**, **303**, **606**, **909** kbps, or **Adaptive**, and supports both **16-bit** and **24-bit PCM input**. You should set LDAC’s input bit-depth to match **exactly** what your player is feeding it to preserve fidelity.

| Playback Scenario                          | Player Output Depth | LDAC Bit-Depth Setting         | Rationale                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pure CD-quality (44.1 kHz / 16-bit)**      | 16-bit              | 16-bit (or "System Selection") | Matches the original 16-bit samples — avoids unnecessary padding, zero-extension, or quantization errors. *System Selection* lets Android auto-choose bit-depth, which usually defaults to 16-bit unless overridden by a hi-res app. |
| **Native Hi-Res (>44.1 kHz / 24-bit)**       | 24-bit              | 24-bit                         | Preserves the full dynamic range of your 24-bit source all the way into LDAC’s encoder.          |
| **Any source + DSP (EQ, gain, fades)**     | 24-bit              | 24-bit                         | Provides headroom for processing; avoids rounding errors during DSP before LDAC encoding.        |
| **Non–bit-perfect apps (mixed to 16-bit)** | 16-bit              | 16-bit (or "System Selection") | Reflects the actual 16-bit data the mixer delivers; keeps your settings honest about input depth. |

>  **Clarification:**  
> LDAC **does not upscale or convert bit-depth**. It encodes audio at **the bit-depth it receives** — 16-bit or 24-bit PCM.  
> Android’s Bluetooth stack forwards the player's output to LDAC without automatic upsampling.  
> -  If the player outputs 16-bit PCM (e.g., CD-quality), LDAC encodes it directly as 16-bit.  
> -  If the player outputs 24-bit PCM, LDAC uses full 24-bit encoding.  
> -  If the player outputs 32-bit float, Android truncates it to 24-bit PCM before LDAC sees it.  

>  Android typically **resamples audio to a global sample rate**, such as 48 kHz or 96 kHz — unless you’re using a bit-perfect player like UAPP or Neutron in exclusive mode. That system-wide output is what LDAC actually encodes — not necessarily the source file’s native format.

>  **The 32-bit setting in Developer Options or BCC is not for LDAC itself**, but for internal processing in apps like UAPP or Neutron, which operate at 32-bit float for DSP. It provides internal headroom but has **no effect on the final transmitted resolution**, which is max 24-bit.

>  **Bit-perfect transmission over LDAC is only achieved** when the player's output bit-depth and sample rate match the source, and no DSP or mixing occurs.

>  LDAC doesn’t transmit raw PCM — it uses a proprietary compression method combining MDCT and Huffman coding. While it’s lossy, LDAC is designed to retain detail up to 24-bit/96kHz with minimal perceptual degradation when properly configured.

>  Reminder: Setting LDAC to 24-bit won’t magically upgrade 16-bit audio. If your player sends 16-bit, that’s exactly what LDAC will encode — no matter what the LDAC bit-depth setting says.
