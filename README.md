# LDAC Done Right

 There is a lot of misconception about LDAC and how to properly configure it on different operating systems (Windows and Android for example.) This guide will focus on both and will include strategies which help you get the best sound possible. I tried to make it as practical as possible to replicate. To make troubleshooting easier I have clearly documented the steps needed to set everything back to defaults for full transparency.


 My setup and the hardware I used during the making of this guide:
 
| Device         | OS / Firmware             | Supported Codecs                       |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Samsung S22 Plus** | One UI 6.1 (Android 14)    | LDAC, SSC, AptX, AAC, SBC               |
| **Samsung S24**      | One UI 6.1 (Android 14)    | LDAC, SSC, AptX, AAC, SBC               |
| **Windows 11**       | Version 24H2               | AAC, SBC *(LDAC not supported natively)* |
| **Windows 10**       | Version 22H2               | AAC, SBC *(LDAC not supported natively)* |
| **Sony WH-1000XM5**  | 2.4.1                      | LDAC, AAC, SBC                          |
| **Sony WH-1000XM3**  | 4.5.2                      | LDAC, AptX, AAC, SBC                    |

> 📌 *Note: On Windows, LDAC support requires specific Bluetooth drivers or third-party implementations (e.g. CSR Harmony stack or alternative USB dongles). This guide focuses on standard OS behavior unless otherwise noted.*
               





 Now that my setup and the software and hardware I use is clear let's dive into what bug in android I solved.
