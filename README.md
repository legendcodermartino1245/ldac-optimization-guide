# LDAC Done Right

There is a lot of misconception about LDAC and how to properly configure it on different operating systems (Windows and Android for example.) This guide will focus on both and will include strategies which help you get the best sound possible. I tried to make it as practical as possible to replicate. To make troubleshooting easier I have clearly documented the steps needed to set everything back to defaults for full transparency.

## My setup and the hardware I used during the making of this guide:

| Device              | OS / Firmware             | Supported Codecs                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Samsung S22 Plus** | One UI 6.1 (Android 14)    | LDAC, SSC, AptX, AAC, SBC               |
| **Samsung S24**      | One UI 6.1 (Android 14)    | LDAC, SSC, AptX, AAC, SBC               |
| **Windows 11**       | Version 24H2               | AAC, SBC *(LDAC not supported natively)* |
| **Windows 10**       | Version 22H2               | AAC, SBC *(LDAC not supported natively)* |
| **Sony WH-1000XM5**  | 2.4.1                      | LDAC, AAC, SBC                          |
| **Sony WH-1000XM3**  | 4.5.2                      | LDAC, AptX, AAC, SBC                    |

> 📌 *Note: On Windows, LDAC support requires specific Bluetooth drivers or third-party implementations (e.g. CSR Harmony stack or alternative USB dongles). This guide focuses on standard OS behavior unless otherwise noted.*

## Inner workings of LDAC

LDAC supports sample rates ranging from **44.1 kHz to 96 kHz**, quality modes of **330**, **660**, **990 kbps**, or **Adaptive**, and always uses **24-bit** precision internally. However, you should set LDAC’s input bit-depth to match **exactly** what your player is feeding it:

| Playback Scenario                          | Player Output Depth | LDAC Bit-Depth Setting         | Rationale                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pure CD-quality (44.1 kHz / 16-bit)**      | 16-bit              | 16-bit (or "System Selection") | Matches the original 16-bit samples—no unnecessary padding or noise.                             |
| **Native Hi-Res (>44.1 kHz / 24-bit)**       | 24-bit              | 24-bit                         | Preserves the full dynamic range of your 24-bit source all the way into LDAC’s encoder.          |
| **Any source + DSP (EQ, gain, fades)**     | 24-bit              | 24-bit                         | Provides headroom for processing; avoids rounding errors during DSP before LDAC encoding.        |
| **Non–bit-perfect apps (mixed to 16-bit)** | 16-bit              | 16-bit (or "System Selection") | Reflects the actual 16-bit data the mixer delivers; keeps your settings honest about input depth. |

> ⚠️ **Clarification:**  
> LDAC always encodes audio at **24-bit precision** — never higher.  
> Selecting **32-bit** in Developer Options or BCC has **no effect** on actual audio quality; it's just an Android-side format wrapper.  
> Even if an app outputs **32-bit float** (which many do by default), Android's audio pipeline will **downmix** it to 24-bit PCM before handing it off to the LDAC encoder.  
> There is **no resolution benefit** from using 32-bit with LDAC — anything above 24-bit is truncated or dithered during encoding.


The **Adaptive** mode dynamically switches between 330–990 kbps depending on available bandwidth and signal strength.

## The Real LDAC Bug: Quality Settings Don’t Apply on Their Own

> **Changing the LDAC quality setting (330 / 660 / 990 / Adaptive) by itself does nothing.**  
> Unless the system renegotiates the entire codec connection, **your change won’t be applied** — even if the UI says it was.

### What Triggers a Real Codec Reset?
LDAC settings like bitrate, sample rate, and bit depth are **only renegotiated** when one of the following is changed:

- A different **codec** is selected (e.g. SBC → LDAC)
- The **sample rate** changes (e.g. 48kHz → 44.1kHz)
- The **bit depth** changes (e.g. 32-bit → 24-bit)

> ⚠️ This is a bug in Android's Bluetooth stack. UI updates don't guarantee actual codec reconfiguration. Bitrate must always be reapplied after reconnection — it is never saved.

## 🔐 Samsung LDAC Override Stack

Samsung **always** enforces its own LDAC codec profile **during the Bluetooth handshake**:

- **Sample Rate:** 96 kHz  
- **Bit Depth:** 32-bit  
- **Bitrate:** Adaptive (330–990 kbps)

This override happens **before** apps like BCC or Music Center can act. Developer Options will show "Playback Quality: Default" if this override is active.

## ✅ Developer Options Are Safe — Just Clean Up After Yourself

Set these **back to default** before disabling Developer Options or handing off control:

- Sample Rate → "Use System Selection"
- Bits Per Sample → "Use System Selection"
- Playback Quality → "Best Effort"

This neeeds to be done for all previously via developer options controlled codecs 

> ✅ *You can safely leave Developer Options enabled — just make sure all codec-related settings are returned to default. No harm is done if they’re inactive.*

> Leaving overridden settings can cause LDAC to renegotiate, trigger Samsung's override again, or break BCC's control.

## Bluetooth Codec Changer (BCC)

### Auto Switch
BCC forces LDAC codec, sample rate, bit depth, and bitrate on connect. Settings are not persistent, so Auto Switch reapplies them with a user-defined delay.

### 2-Step Switch

| Step | Description                         |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| 1    | Initial connection                  |
| 2    | System selects default codec (LDAC) |
| 3    | Force SBC to reset LDAC session     |
| 4    | Delay (500–2000 ms)                |
| 5    | Reapply LDAC with target profile    |
| 6    | LDAC clean handshake achieved       |

### Why 2-Step Doesn't Work on Samsung
Samsung enforces LDAC **before** BCC acts. Step 3 (SBC switch) fails to reset the override. BCC GUI does show incorrect values. Workaround: apply profile twice or use Tasker automation.

## Verify BCC Isn’t Lying

Use this PowerShell script to monitor real-time LDAC status:

```powershell
while ($true) {
    Clear-Host
    adb shell dumpsys bluetooth_manager | Select-String "ldac"
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
}
