##  Settings That Interfere with LDAC 990kbps

These settings are known to interfere with LDAC 990kbps stability and should be disabled or adjusted:

1. **Google Assistant**  
   - Must be disabled both on the **headset** and the **phone itself**.  
   - Don't just disable the Google app — instead, **grant Nearby Devices permission back**, then disable Google Assistant cleanly in settings.

2. **Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Scanning**  
   - Must be disabled completely to prevent background interference.  
   - Includes Developer Option toggles **and** ADB permission removal for Google Play Services.

3. **Hotspot Band**  
   - Set your mobile hotspot to **5GHz**.  
   - **2.4GHz hotspots** interfere with LDAC stability.

4. **Wi-Fi Network Type**  
   - If your network is **only 2.4GHz**, disable Wi-Fi entirely.

5. **Music Sharing**  
   - Disable Samsung’s **Bluetooth Music Sharing** feature.

6. **Nearby Devices & Saved Device Scanning**  
   Disabling Nearby Devices **permission** is **not enough**. Google Play Services still performs background scanning and override syncing unless you explicitly disable both of the following:

    Disable **Nearby device scanning** under:  
   - `Settings > Google > Devices & Sharing > Devices > Scan for nearby devices`  
     → **Turn this OFF**

    Disable **Saved Devices auto-sync** under:  
   - `Settings > Google > Devices & Sharing > Saved Devices`  
     → Tap ** (3-dot menu)** and select **“Turn off Automatically Save Devices”**

>  **Explanation:**  
> Even with permission denied, Google may silently reassert Fast Pair metadata using background scan and sync logic.  
> These toggles prevent both the **search for new nearby Bluetooth devices** *and* the **cloud syncing of stored override profiles**, which often reintroduce the Samsung LDAC default.

7. **Smartwatch & BLE Companion Apps**  
   - Uninstall apps like Galaxy Wearable, Zepp, etc.  
   - Forget any unused **Bluetooth LE devices**.

8. **Samsung-Specific Features**  
   - Disable:
     - **Samsung Nearby Devices**
     - **Samsung Multi Control**

9. **Google Location Accuracy**  
   - Disable under:  
     `Settings > Location > Location Services > Google Location Accuracy`

10. **Saved Devices in Google Services**  
    - Prevent Google from syncing or overriding LDAC profiles.

11. **Switching to Better Networks**  
    - Found in Wi-Fi settings under “Advanced.”  
    - Disable to prevent mid-session access point switching.

12. **NFC Usage**  
    - Having **NFC enabled is fine**, but **using NFC during LDAC playback** (e.g., pairing via tap) causes codec renegotiation.  
    - Avoid using NFC features while listening.

13. **Spotify Nearby Devices Permission**  
    - Disable Spotify’s **Nearby Devices** permission under:  
      `Settings > Apps > Spotify > Permissions > Nearby Devices → Deny`  
    - Explanation:  
      - Spotify periodically performs **background device discovery** to detect Cast devices, Spotify Connect speakers, and other targets.
      - These discovery scans occur over BLE and 2.4GHz, which directly interfere with **LDAC 990kbps transmission stability**.
      - Disabling this permission minimizes background scanning load during LDAC playback.
